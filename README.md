# CI-Training
Welcome to my bootcamp exercises repository for writing CI/CD pipelines at Jenkins.

## How To Use
Steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Create a new branch (<your_name>_solutions)
- Under (<your_name>_solutions), create anoter branch (<your_name>_solution_exercise<Number>)
- go to the relevant exercise (for example: exercise1)
- read the exercise.md and explaination.md file carefully.
- create a new folder in the exercise folder named solution
- add to the solution folder all the groovy files and also a md file with all the relevant links(to your jobs for example).
- create pull request for the branch (<your_name>_solution_exercise<Number>) to (<your_name>_solutions).
- ask for review from the author (Adi Roth).

after getting the review you can move on to the next exercise, and also you'll get a full report about your solution, that will explation you everything.
